# Placebo-Study
Study on placebo effect and memory, analysis in R

## Abstract
The placebo effect has been shown to have significant impacts across many psychological domains. This study investigated the impact of an expectancy-inducing placebo on declarative memory. 21 participants were asked to memorize a series of nonsense syllables after viewing either a memory-positive or memory-neutral placebo stimulus. Participants were also assessed on their knowledge of the placebo effect. No significant differences were observed in terms of memory performance between treatment and control, or across different levels of placebo knowledge; however, a significant interaction effect emerged, with larger treatment-control differences in those with higher levels of placebo knowledge. These results highlight the importance of expectancies in conscious processing.

## Hypotheses
The hypotheses investigated were two univariate models, and one multivariate model.

## Variables Measured
7 variables were measured in total. 3 were demographic; one DV (memory performance) and two IVs (placebo or none, placebo knowledge) were measured.

## Study Procedure
1. Participants were emailed an anonymous survey, with either placebo-enhancing video or placebo-neutral video.
2. Participants were asked to recall 2 sets of 10 nonsense syllables to assess memory.

## Results
![results](results.png)

Univariate slopes were nonsignificant. However, a significant interaction effect emerged--those with higher levels of placebo knowledge showed a stronger placebo effect (improved memory performance in the treatment condition) as compared to those with lower levels of placebo knowledge.
